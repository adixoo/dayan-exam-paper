 **Here's the solution step-by-step, with KaTeX-compatible mathematical statements:**

**1. Identify the given values:**

* First term (a₁) = 5
* Common difference (d) = 3
* Number of terms (n) = 20

**2. Apply the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:**

* $S_n = \dfrac{n}{2} \cdot (2a_1 + (n - 1)d)$

**3. Substitute the values into the formula:**

* S₂₀ = 20/2 ⋅ (2 ⋅ 5 + (20 - 1) ⋅ 3)

**4. Simplify the expression:**

* S₂₀ = 10 ⋅ (10 + 57)
* S₂₀ = 10 ⋅ 67

**5. Calculate the final result:**

* S₂₀ = 670

**Therefore, the sum of the first 20 terms of the arithmetic progression is 670.**
