# Mathematics Exam - 2

## Questions

1. Find the zeroes of the quadratic polynomial $x^2+ 7x + 10$, and verify the relationship between the zeroes and the coefficients.
2. Find the roots of the quadratic equation $3x^2 - 2 \sqrt{6}x+ 2 = 0$
3.  In $\triangle ABC$, right-angled at B, if $tan(A) = \dfrac{1}{3}$ find the value of:
      - $sin A cos C + cos A sin C$
      - $cos A cos C â€“ sin A sin C$

4.   A chord of a circle of radius 10 cm subtends a right angle at the centre. Find the area of the corresponding: (i) minor segment (ii) major sector. (Use $\pi = 3.14$)
5.   Prove that $\sqrt{3}$ is irrational.
6.   A tent is in the shape of a cylinder surmounted by a conical top. If the height and diameter of the cylindrical part are 2.1 m and 4 m respectively, and the slant height of the top is 2.8 m, find the area of the canvas used for making the tent. Also, find the cost of the canvas of the tent at the rate of $\u20B9 500 per m^2$. (Note that the base of the tent will not be covered with canvas.)
7. A carton consists of 100 shirts of which 88 are good, 8 have minor defects and 4 have major defects. Jimmy, a trader, will only accept the shirts which are good, but Sujatha, another trader, will only reject the shirts which have major defects. One shirt is drawn at random from the carton. What is the probability that
         -  (i) it is acceptable to Jimmy?
         -  (ii) it is acceptable to Sujatha?
