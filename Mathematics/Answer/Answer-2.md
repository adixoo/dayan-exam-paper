         -  (ii) it is acceptable to Sujatha?




1. **Find the zeroes of the quadratic polynomial $x^2+ 7x + 10$, and verify the relationship between the zeroes and the coefficients.**

    Steps to solve:
    **1. Use the quadratic formula:**
    $$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$
    where a, b, and c are the coefficients of the quadratic equation. In this case, a = 1, b = 7, and c = 10. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
    $$x = \frac{-7 \pm \sqrt{7^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 10}}{2 \cdot 1}$$
    $$x = \frac{-7 \pm \sqrt{9}}{2}$$
    
    **2. Simplify:**
    $$x = \frac{-7 \pm 3}{2}$$
    
    **3. Separate the equations and solve:**
    $$x = -2$$
    $$x = -5$$
    
    **Answer:**
    The zeroes of the quadratic polynomial $x^2+7x+10$ are **x = -2** and **x = -5**.
    
    **Verification of the relationship between the zeroes and the coefficients:**
    According to Vieta's formulas, the sum of the zeroes of a quadratic equation is equal to the negative of the coefficient b divided by a, and the product of the zeroes is equal to c divided by a. In this case, we can verify that:
    
    * Sum of zeroes: (-2) + (-5) = -7 = -b/a
    * Product of zeroes: (-2) * (-5) = 10 = c/a
    
    Therefore, the relationship between the zeroes and the coefficients is verified.

2. **Find the roots of the quadratic equation $3x^2 - 2 \sqrt{6}x+ 2 = 0$**

      
      1. **Identify the coefficients:**
         - $a = 3$
         - $b = -2\sqrt{6}$
         - $c = 2$
      
      2. **Apply the quadratic formula:**
         $$x = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$
      
      3. **Substitute the coefficients:**
         $$x = \dfrac{+2\sqrt{6} \pm \sqrt{(-2\sqrt{6})^2 - 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2}}{2 \cdot 3}$$
      
      4. **Simplify the expression under the radical:**
         $$x = \dfrac{2\sqrt{6} \pm \sqrt{24 - 24}}{6}$$
         $$x = \dfrac{2\sqrt{6} \pm \sqrt{0}}{6}$$
      
      5. **Reduce the expression:**
         $$x = \dfrac{2\sqrt{6}}{6}$$
      
      6. **Simplify the fraction:**
         $$x = \dfrac{\sqrt{6}}{3}$$
      
      **Therefore, the quadratic equation $3x^2 - 2 \sqrt{6}x+ 2 = 0$ has a single root, which is $x = \dfrac{\sqrt{6}}{3}$.**
